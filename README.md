# Scientific visualization Course 

> Visualisation is a method of computing. It transforms the symbolic into the geometric, enabling researchers to observe their simulations and computations. Visualisation offers a method for seeing the unseen. It enriches the process of scientific discovery and fosters profound and unexpected insights.

## Course

* **[Scientific Visualization](dataviz.pdf)** (**PDF**). A gentle
     introduction to scientific visualization reviewing some concepts,
     definitions and rules.

* **[Introduction](01-introduction.ipynb)** (**notebook**). In this
    introduction, we'll see how to make a figure and play with the
    different settings such as to improve the rendering. We'll also
    see how to compose a figure made of several subplots with a
    moderatly complex layout.

* **[Catalogue](02-catalogue.ipynb)** (**notebook**). In this lesson,
  we'll review the many different types of plot matplotlib offers and
  manipulate them, namely, plot, scatter, imshow and bar plots.

* **[Scales & projections](03-scale-projection.ipynb)**
  (**notebook**). Matplotlib offers the possibility to use different
  scales (log scale, symlog scale, logit scale) and projections
  (polar, 3D, geographic). We'll review a few of them in this lesson.

* **[Animation](04-animation.ipynb)** (**notebook**). Animation with
  matplotlib can be created very easily using the animation
  framework. During this lesson, we'll show how to create an animation
  and save it as a movie.
